# OpenLayers and Open Street Map Experiments

Requires:
* OpenLayers-2.13.1
* jQuery-1.10.2

1: Map with dropdown menu for drawings

2: Toolbar for drawing lines, polygons, points and measurements

3: Select vector features from multiple layers

4: Draw some lines and show their data in popup. Point location from map. Use longitude/latitude coordinates (WGS84) to show and work with data and transform to Mercator projection (EPSG:900913, EPSG:3857, WGS84 Web Mercator) for OpenStreetMap. WGS84 (EPSG:4326) treats the earth as an ellipsoid while EPSG:900913 treats it as a sphere.
